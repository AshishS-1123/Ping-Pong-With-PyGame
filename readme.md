# Ping Pong with PyGame #

This project is a simple Python game developed using the PyGame module.
The game consists of two paddles, one is controlled by the user, the other by the computer
To control the user paddle, use the arrow keys (right and left).
The computer paddle is automatic and moves on its own by deciding where the ball is going to hit
If the ball hits the upper or lower corner of screen, game is over
At the end of the game, the time for which the user played is displayed on the screen

The resources folder contains the images for the paddle and the ball
